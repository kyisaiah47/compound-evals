"""Prove each grader before the environment ships.

For every task: run the honest outcome and require 1.0, then run each cheat and require 0.0.
A cheat here is not a broken rollout. Every one leaves the database in a state that reads as
finished to anyone looking at the console, which is the whole reason the graders read rows.

    uv run python envs/parserail-desk/adversarial/prove_graders.py

Exit 0 only if every expectation holds.

⛔ IT DEGRADES WHEN THE APP IS NOT RUNNING, AND THAT IS ON PURPOSE. The cheats are pure SQL and
always run. The honest cases drive the real product, so they need it serving on 3769; when it is
not, they are SKIPPED with a printed line rather than failed. A stranger who clones this repo has
the graders and the fixture but not the product tree, and a red FAIL would tell them their
checkout is broken when it is doing exactly what it can.
