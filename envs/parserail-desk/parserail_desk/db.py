"""Direct Postgres access for the graders.

⛔ THE GRADER NEVER ASKS THE APP. It connects to the database the app writes to and reads the
rows itself. Asking the app whether it succeeded is asking the thing under test to mark its own
work, and an HTTP 200 is what a broken write looks like from the outside.

It reads the same `compound_*` tables the app writes. Until 2026-09-29 those names were views
over older tables a rename sweep left behind; production renamed the tables that day, and the
fixture schema matches it.
