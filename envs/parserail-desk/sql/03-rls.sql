-- parserail-desk: the product's real RLS posture, read off production on 2026-09-19.
--
-- ⛔ RLS IS ON AND THERE IS NOT ONE POLICY. `select tablename, policyname from pg_policies where
-- tablename like 'compound\_%'` returns zero rows against the live project, while
-- pg_class.relrowsecurity is true on all seven tables. That is deliberate and it is the whole
-- security model of this product: the only client that ever touches these tables is
-- `adminSupabase()`, the service-role client, which bypasses RLS. Nothing signed in as `anon` or
-- `authenticated` can read or write a row, so a stolen anon key buys a reader nothing.
--
-- Reproducing it matters here because it is what makes the tenancy guards real rather than
-- decorative. Every route already scopes its own query (`.eq("account_id", user.id)` on revoke,
-- `.eq("account_id", auth.accountId)` on memory forget, `getJob(id, accountId)` on job polling),
-- and with RLS shut the database is the second wall: a cross-tenant write in this environment is
-- something only a cheat holding the service role can do, which is exactly the shape of the
-- cross-tenant cheats in prove_graders.py.
