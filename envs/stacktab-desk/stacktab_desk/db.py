"""Direct Postgres access for the graders.

⛔ THE GRADER NEVER ASKS THE APP. It connects to the database the app writes to and reads the
rows itself. Asking the app whether it succeeded is asking the thing under test to mark its own
work, and an HTTP 200 is what a broken write looks like from the outside. This product makes that
literal: POST /api/watch answers `{"ok": true}` for a filled honeypot and stores nothing at all,
and `{"ok": true}` again for a service slug the catalogue has never heard of.

⛔ AND IT HAS TO BE POSTGRES RATHER THAN POSTGREST. `stacktab_price_watch` has row level security
enabled and NO POLICY, which is the correct shape: only the service role can see the watch list.
A grader holding the publishable key would read zero rows and score every task 0.0.

The five tables are real tables, not views. Checked against pg_class on the production project
before a line of this was written; parserail's turned out to be views over older table names.
