-- stacktab-desk: the product's real tables, as they stand in the shared production project
-- xowekqdsttxwbhfxvusa on 2026-09-19. Pulled column by column, index by index and constraint by
-- constraint through the Supabase MCP; nothing here is inferred from the TypeScript types.
--
-- ⛔ THEY ARE REAL TABLES, NOT VIEWS. parserail's `compound_*` names turned out to be views over
-- older tables left behind by the 2026-09-10 rename sweep, so this was checked first:
--   select c.relname, c.relkind from pg_class c join pg_namespace n on n.oid = c.relnamespace
--   where n.nspname = 'public' and c.relname like 'stacktab%';
-- answered relkind 'r' for all five. The graders read these names directly.
--
-- ⛔ `stacktab_price_watch.id` IS `generated always as identity`, not a sequence default. An
-- insert that supplies its own id needs `overriding system value`, which is why the seed says so
-- and why a cheat that writes the row by hand has to as well.
--
-- ⛔ `stacktab_price_watch_unique` WAS A PLAIN UNIQUE CONSTRAINT OVER A NULLABLE COLUMN, which is
-- the defect this environment found. Postgres treats two NULLs as distinct unless the index says
-- `nulls not distinct`, and `service_slug` is null for the whole-catalogue watch, which is the
-- ONLY scope the product's own form can produce. So the upsert in POST /api/watch never found a
-- conflict and wrote a fresh row on every submission.
--
-- FIXED IN PRODUCTION 2026-09-19, migration `stacktab_price_watch_nulls_not_distinct`, and this
-- file carries the fixed shape because the fixture reproduces what production HAS. The task that
-- graded the old behaviour is being re-derived against the new one; see README.

-- Reproduced verbatim, including `nulls not distinct`; see the note at the top.
-- ⛔ DROPPED AND RECREATED RATHER THAN `if not exists`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS
-- BLOCK. The shared stack was provisioned before the migration, so it already holds an index by
-- this name, and `create unique index if not exists` is a silent no-op against it: the file would
-- read `nulls not distinct` while the database kept treating two NULLs as distinct keys, and the
-- environment would grade behaviour nobody is running. It also arrives as a CONSTRAINT in
-- production before the migration and as a bare INDEX after it, so both are dropped. Converges
-- from either state, and from nothing.
