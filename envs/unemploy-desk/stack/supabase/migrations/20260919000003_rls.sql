-- Row level security, the storage bucket and its policies.

-- Read out of the live project on 2026-09-19 with pg_policies and pg_get_functiondef. The three
-- helper functions are reproduced verbatim, including the demo account's address, which the
-- deployed functions read as `demo@thecompound.tech` since 2026-09-29.

-- ⛔ WHY AN ENVIRONMENT NEEDS THIS AT ALL. Without RLS every grader's tenant check is enforced
-- only by the grader. With it, the database refuses a cross-tenant write before the grader ever
-- runs, which is how production behaves, so a rollout that scores zero here scores zero for the
-- same reason it would have failed a real customer's account.
