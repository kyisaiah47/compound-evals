-- breachprobe-desk, RLS. Production's own posture, read off pg_policies on
-- xowekqdsttxwbhfxvusa on 2026-09-19: row-level security is ENABLED on all six tables and
-- there is NOT ONE POLICY on any of them. The query returned an empty set.
--
-- That is not an oversight in the product. BreachProbe has no accounts, no sign-in and no
-- browser-side database client: `src/lib/db.ts` is a raw service-role REST helper and its own
-- header says it must never be imported into a client component. So the anon and authenticated
-- roles reach nothing, and every write in the product arrives on the service role, which
-- bypasses RLS by design.
--
-- Reproducing it exactly is what makes the tenancy guards in the taskset mean something. In this
-- environment a cross-customer write is not something a confused route can do; it is something
-- only a cheat holding the service role can do, which is precisely the distinction the graders
-- are drawing.
--
-- `compound_email_suppressions` is a view and carries no RLS of its own (relrowsecurity false in
-- production); it inherits the posture of the table under it.
