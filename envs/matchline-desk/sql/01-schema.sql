-- matchline-desk: the product's real tables, pulled from the shared production project
-- xowekqdsttxwbhfxvusa on 2026-09-19 with the Supabase MCP.
--
-- MatchLine has exactly TWO tables and no functions, no triggers and no views. Both are real
-- TABLES (pg_class.relkind = 'r'), checked rather than assumed: parserail's turned out to be
-- VIEWS over older tables left behind by a rename sweep, so relkind is read now for
-- every product.
--
--   ml_matches   one free check. The route inserts it `pending` with both documents; the local
--                worker (ops/worker.mjs) writes `result` and then nulls the two text columns.
--   ml_orders    one paid tailoring. The checkout route inserts it `created`; the worker
--                delivers it and mints the delete token the delivery email carries.
--
-- Every column, default, check constraint, foreign key and index below is the production
-- definition byte for byte, including the duplicate index on stripe_session_id (the unique
-- CONSTRAINT and a separate unique INDEX both exist upstream). It is reproduced rather than
-- tidied, because an environment that improves the schema is not running the product's schema.
--
-- ⛔ NO auth.users ROW IS CREATED BY THIS ENVIRONMENT, and rule 11 still applies. MatchLine has
-- no accounts, no sign-in and no user_id column anywhere: every surface is anonymous and every
-- write goes through the service key. The uuid block 00000000-0000-4000-8000-0000000f7001 and
-- upward is reserved for matchline-desk on the SHARED auth.users so nothing else claims it, and
-- the fixture's own ids are carved out of the same block (…0f70xx) for the two ml_ tables.
