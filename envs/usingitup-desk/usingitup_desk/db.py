"""Direct Postgres access for the graders.

THE GRADER NEVER ASKS THE APP. It connects to the database the app writes to and reads the rows
itself. Asking the app whether it succeeded is asking the thing under test to mark its own work,
and an HTTP 200 is what a broken write looks like from the outside. This product makes that
literal twice over:

  POST /api/subscribe answers `{"ok": true}` for a filled honeypot and stores nothing at all.
  POST /api/subscribe/unsubscribe answers 200 with an empty body to any caller that did not ask
  for HTML, BEFORE it has looked at whether a row matched. A token for a publication this site is
  not, or a token that was never issued, both come back 200 with nobody taken off any list.

AND IT HAS TO BE POSTGRES RATHER THAN POSTGREST. `publication_subscribers` has row level security
enabled and NO POLICY, which is the correct shape for a mailing list: only the service role can
see an address. A grader holding the publishable key reads zero rows and scores every task 0.0.

The three tables are real tables, not views. Checked against pg_class on the production project
before a line of this was written; parserail's turned out to be views over older table names.

    a neighbour's reset can hold a row lock on the same pages. The seed sets `lock_timeout` to 5
    seconds, so a conflict comes back as an error in a second or two instead of deadlocking, and
    this backs off and tries again. A conflict that survives every attempt is raised, because at
